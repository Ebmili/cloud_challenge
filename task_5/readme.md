In this task I learnt the basics of the SQL ðŸ’™

I know now, what are:

âœ… Databases
âœ… How to create a table using SQL
âœ… I created my SQL instance in google clound and connected it with the Dbeaver.

Also, I can now perform basic functions of SQL:

INSERT data INTO a database,
DELETE data FROM a database,
UPDATE data in a database,
SELECT (extract) data FROM a database

And using a query: SELECT AVG(column_age) I can answear to the question: what is average age of the students in the class?

After inserting a query, 
I got the answer: 

avg                |
